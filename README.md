MSDS 6306 Case Study 2 - Attrition
Author: Nicholas Sager

**Executive Summary**
DDSAnalytics is an analytics company that specializes in talent management solutions for Fortune 100 companies. Talent management is defined as the iterative process of developing and retaining employees. It may include workforce planning, employee training programs, identifying high-potential employees and reducing/preventing voluntary employee turnover (attrition). To gain a competitive edge over its competition, DDSAnalytics is planning to leverage data science for talent management. The executive leadership has identified predicting employee turnover as its first application of data science for talent management. Before the business green lights the project, they have tasked our data science team to conduct an analysis of existing employee data. 

Given a dataset (CaseStudy2-data.csv on AWS S3 in the ddsproject1 bucket), we will do a data analysis to identify factors that lead to attrition.  We will identify the top three factors that contribute to turnover (backed up by evidence provided by analysis). There may or may not be a need to create derived attributes/variables/features. The business is also interested in learning about any job role specific trends that may exist in the data set (e.g., “Data Scientists have the highest job satisfaction”). We will also provide any other interesting trends and observations from our analysis. The analysis will be backed up by robust experimentation and appropriate visualization. Experiments and analysis will be conducted in R. We will also to build a model to predict attrition.  Finally, we will develop an RShiny App to visualize some of the relationships or lack thereof.
